# Exercise 03:04

Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

```text
   scanf("%d%f%d", &i, &x, &j);
```

If the user enters
```text 
10.3 5 6
```

what will be the values of i, x, and j after the call? (Assume that i and j are int variables
and x is a float variable.)

```text
i = 10
x = undefined | weird behavior
j = 5
# the scanf will find the . and terminates the process
```
