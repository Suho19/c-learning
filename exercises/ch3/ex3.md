# Exercise 03:03

Explanation for the matching formatted strings versus the correct input:

```text
    "%d" versus " %d" == matches any digit entered
    "%d-%d-%d" versus "%d -%d-%d" matches any data like input but the next one must followed by a space
    "%f" vs "%f " just the like second one
    "%f,%f" vs "%f, %f" it maches the previous one but followed by the comma is a space
```
